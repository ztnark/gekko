## Main features

* Automated trading (trade bot)

## TA strategies

Gekko comes with some [example strategies](../strategies/example_strategies.md) (which implement a single indicator). But with some basic javascript you can [create your own strategies](../strategies/creating_a_strategy.md). You can use over 130 indicators to create your perfect prediction model ([full list](../strategies/talib_indicators.md) of supported indicators). *Why don't you combine Bollinger Bands, CCI and MACD with a STOCHRSI indicator?*

## Automated Trading platform

Gekko can watch the realtime markets, you can TA strategies to do live or simulated trading. Gekko stores all market data it sees, this makes it possible to simulate trading strategies against historical data to see whether they would have been profitable (backtesting).

Gekko is not built for HFT or anything related to being the fastest (like arbitrage). The trading methods Gekko can do are based on TA indicators used by human day traders. This means that Gekko does not look at data below the one minute timescale and will not trade more than a couple of times per week (depending on configuration).

## Gekko is not

- A trading platform for human day traders (although it can be used to support human traders)
- A High frequency trading bot designed to operate on < minute resolution
- A fully automated trading bot that you turn on and will generate profit without you having to do anything
- An exchange
- An arbitrage bot
